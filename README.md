# Vextor
The title of the project comes from a mix of the words _backtester_, _vector_ and _saxo_, since it was conceived of as a vectorized backtester connected to the [SaxoTraderGo](https://www.home.saxo/da-dk/platforms/saxotradergo) trading platform. At this point the project is more of a package containing a trading strategy base class, from which to implemented quantitative trading rules, and a small collection of backtesters, like looping and vectorized.

To install the project from github

`pip install git+https://github.com/NicolaiBanke/Baxter.git`.
