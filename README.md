# Baxter
The title of the project comes from a mix of the words _backtester_, _vector_ and _saxo_, since it was conceived of as a vectorized backtester connected to the [SaxoTraderGo](https://www.home.saxo/da-dk/platforms/saxotradergo) trading platform. At this point the project is more of a package containing a trading strategy base class, from which to implemented quantitative trading rules, and a small collection of backtesters, like looping and vectorized, and in the future probably an event-driven one that can connect to the Saxo-API for paper trading.

To install the project from github
